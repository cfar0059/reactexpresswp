## Full Stack Task

Task:
You have been requested to create a contact form having the following required fields: Name, Surname, Email, Message,

1. Responsive;

4. Shows errors nicely to the user in case of validation errors;

2. All code needs to be a code-versioned repo of your choice, with detailed commits;
3. All work needs to be well commented;
